# FanPulse API

FanPulse is a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) API designed to manage and provide data related to teams, players, matches, competitions, and areas. It serves as the backbone for front-end applications, providing the necessary API endpoints to fetch and display the required data.

This project is built using **Flask**, **Flask-RESTful**, and **PostgreSQL**, and incorporates best practices like **Flake8** for linting and **Dependency Injection (DI)** for better code maintainability and testability.

## Features

- Search for **teams**, **players**, **competitions**, and **areas** with an intuitive search bar.
- View detailed **player statistics** and **team information**.
- Filter matches by date, status, and type (e.g., upcoming, live, completed).
- View **upcoming matches** with related details (teams, date, time, scores).
- **Real-time search suggestions** for teams, players, competitions, and areas, powered by server-side filtering.
- **Responsive Design** ensuring optimal experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Database restore functionality** for PostgreSQL to ensure the application runs with the correct data.
- **Server-side filtering** for fetching and displaying only relevant data based on user input, improving performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9** or higher
- **PostgreSQL** (for database)
- **Virtualenv** (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fanpulse-bff.git
cd fanpulse-bff
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Database Setup (Restore Database)

Before running the app, ensure that the PostgreSQL database is restored. Follow these steps:

1. **Ensure PostgreSQL is installed** on your system.
2. **Restore the database**: Ensure you have the PostgreSQL database backup to restore. Run the following command to restore the database:

```bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d fanpulse < path_to_your_backup.sql
```

Replace `path_to_your_backup.sql` with the actual path to your backup file. Ensure that the `fanpulse` database is created or replace it with the appropriate name if necessary.

3. **Update the password**: In your `.env` file, make sure to update the database password with the correct value. Add the necessary environment variables (explained below).

### Running the Backend (BFF)

1. **Start the Backend (BFF) Server**: Ensure that your Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) API is running, as the React app will fetch data from it.

```bash
cd path_to_your_bff
flask run
```

This will start the backend server locally on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running the Frontend (React App)

1. **Start the React App**:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React app locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

Ensure that the backend BFF is running before starting the React app. The frontend will fetch the data from the backend, and without it, the app won't work correctly.

### Docker Setup

1. **Build the Docker Image**:  
   To build the Docker image for the app, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t fanpulse-bff .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:  
   After building the Docker image, run the container using this command:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 fanpulse-bff
```

The app will be accessible on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

Below are the available API endpoints for the application:

### /api/teams
- **GET**: Fetch a list of all teams.

### /api/teams/{id}
- **GET**: Fetch the details of a specific team by ID.

### /api/players
- **GET**: Fetch a list of all players.

### /api/players/{id}
- **GET**: Fetch the details of a specific player by ID.

### /api/matches
- **GET**: Fetch a list of matches with optional filters.  
   **Filters**:
   - `date`: Filter by match date.
   - `status`: Filter by match status (e.g., scheduled, live, completed).
   - `season`: Filter by season.
   - `team_name`: Filter by team name.

### /api/competitions
- **GET**: Fetch a list of all competitions.

### /api/areas
- **GET**: Fetch a list of all areas.

### /api/areas/{area_id}
- **GET**: Fetch the details of a specific area by `area_id`.

---

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- **DATABASE_URL**: The PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/fanpulse`).
- **FLASK_APP**: The Flask app entry point (default is `app.py`).
- **FLASK_ENV**: The environment for Flask (development, production, etc.).

### Example of setting environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/fanpulse
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
```

---

## Testing

Make sure to run tests before deploying or making changes to the codebase.

1. **Run Unit Tests**:  
   To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that your tests are well-covered to maintain application quality.

## Technologies & Features

### **Flask**  
- The app is built with **Flask**, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, perfect for building web APIs.

### **Flask-RESTful**  
- **Flask-RESTful** is used to create REST APIs with Flask. It simplifies the creation of API endpoints and helps handle requests and responses in a structured way. This project uses **Flask-RESTful** to create all necessary endpoints for managing teams, players, matches, competitions, and areas. It aids in defining API resources and methods to ensure cleaner and more maintainable code.

### **Flake8**  
- The project uses **Flake8** for **linting** to ensure consistent code style and to catch potential issues early in the development process.

### **Dependency Injection (DI)**  
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is used to decouple services and improve code maintainability and testing. Services like database connections, external APIs, etc., are injected into the classes that need them.

### **PostgreSQL**  
- The app uses **PostgreSQL** as its database, ensuring robust, relational data storage. Data is fetched dynamically via the **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** API.

### **Server-side Filtering**  
- The matches, teams, players, and areas are fetched from the backend based on filter criteria, ensuring that only relevant data is shown, improving performance.

### **Linting**  
- The **linting functionality** ensure good code quality.
